# **Challenge:**

- Many tools exist to help employers find the right employees, but there are few resources to help individuals find roles in which they will thrive.

We are developing a system that leverages AI to analyze resumes and LinkedIn profiles, along with job information, to predict job satisfaction. The process includes:

- **Collecting Data:** We gather information from LinkedIn, job boards, and employee surveys.
- **Building a Model:** We analyze job descriptions and career histories to identify factors that contribute to job satisfaction.
- **Improving Over Time:** We continually update the model with new data and feedback to enhance its accuracy.

# **Impact:**

Our tool simplifies the process of making informed career choices:

- **Better Career Decisions:** It assists everyone from students to seasoned professionals in selecting careers they are likely to enjoy.
- **Tailored Education:** Educational institutions can use our insights to better prepare students for satisfying careers.
- **Better Job Matching:** Employers benefit from acquiring employees who are happier and more likely to remain with the company.
- **Economic Benefits:** Our tool helps reduce job mismatches and improve the efficiency of the job market.

Our system is designed to guide individuals towards careers where they can be both successful and satisfied, benefiting all stakeholders in the job market.
